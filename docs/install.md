### Installation methods

Partis can be installed via: 
  - [pip](#installation-with-pip): recommended, but only supports core functions (no simulation or plotting)
  - [with Docker](#installation-with-docker)
  - [from scratch](#installation-from-scratch)
  - additional steps for simulation installation:
    - [install some R packages](#simulation)

#### Installation with pip

This is the recommended method unless you want to run simulation or plotting.
First install system dependencies:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python-is-python3 pipx build-essential cmake libgsl-dev libyaml-cpp-dev scons mafft ncurses-base ncurses-bin

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install python3 pipx cmake gsl yaml-cpp scons mafft
```

Install from PyPI (recommended):
```bash
pipx install partis-bcr
```
Alternatively, you can install from source if you think you'll want to modify the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/psathyrella/partis.git
cd partis

# Initialize essential submodule
git submodule update --init packages/ham

# Create virtual environment and install
python -m venv partis-env
source partis-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: partis-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

##### Testing the installation

```bash
# Run quick test
partis-test.py --quick

# Run more complete test (still without simulation, since the base/pip install above doesn't install simulation requirements)
partis-test.py --no-simu
partis-test.py --paired --no-simu
```

#### Installation with Docker

Docker can be installed using the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com). If you're new to Docker, start with the official [quick start](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide. Then,

```
sudo docker pull quay.io/matsengrp/partis
sudo docker run -it --user=root --name container-1 -v ~:/host/home quay.io/matsengrp/partis /bin/bash
```
The `sudo` may not be necessary for some systems. With `docker run`, we create a new container from (i.e. instance of) the partis image. The `-v` mounts your home directory on the host machine to the path `/host/home` inside the container, so we can easily extract results.
The `--user=root` is a temporary fix: mamba uses the `mambauser` user inside docker, but it is difficult to mount the host filesystem in a way such that it is writeable by the mambauser.

Docker's default escape key is ctrl-p, which unfortunately conflicts with common command line shortcuts. To change this put`{"detachKeys": "ctrl-q,q"}` into the file `~/.docker/config.json` which will swap it to ctrl-q.

When finished, you probably don't want to just exit and `docker run` again -- this will create a new container from scratch, whereas you usually want to re-enter the previous container.
One solution is to run Docker inside [tmux](https://hackernoon.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-tmux-8d784c404340?gi=70388a0228fb) in which case you can just leave the container open.
Alternatively, you can detach from the container with `ctrl-q q` (or whatever you've remapped ctrl-p q to).
To then reattach to this running container, run `docker attach container-1`.
If you don't plan on reattaching to a container, you should run with `--rm` so it is removed when you exit; otherwise you'll use up a lot of disk space with accumulated old containers (view with `sudo docker ps -a`).

#### Installation from scratch

To install without Docker, you basically need to run the commands in the [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile), starting by installing [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) (essentially an alternate flavor of conda).
You can probably ignore the `$MAMBA_USER` stuff.
Because mamba/conda and pip do not play well with each other, if you've used pip in the past but are going to now use conda, and you won't need pip in the future, you should completely remove `~/.local`.
If you might need pip in the future, you should expect some difficulty with having both conda and pip on the same system.
In most cases you can prevent conda from finding the packages in `~/.local` (and consequently breaking) by setting `export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=True` (see [this issue](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/448) for some context).
You may also need to `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
If you're on a debian variant, run the apt-get install as written.
On other distros, or on macOS, you'll have to figure out the equivalent package names, but after that just swap yum/brew for apt-get.
In place of `COPY`, you should clone the partis repo and init/update its submodules:
```
git clone git@github.com:psathyrella/partis
cd partis
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
`ARG` lines should be `export` commands, and substitute the line `WORKDIR /partis` with `cd partis/`.

In order to avoid polluting your environment, we do not automatically add partis to your path.
Several methods of accomplishing this are described [here](subcommands.md#subcommands).

#### Simulation

By default, partis simulation generates trees using the R packages TreeSim and TreeSimGM, so if not already present they'll need to be installed (along with R).
Alternatively, if you have a list of your own newick trees in a file you can pass this in with `--input-simulation-treefname`, in which case you can avoid R installation entirely.
One way to install R on debian/ubuntu (and thus also within a partis container) is:
```
apt-get install -y dirmngr apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common gnupg2
# UPDATE maybe should be keyserver.ubuntu.com?
apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF'  # this R installation stuff was in the Dockerfile for a while, but this line was crashing on dockerhub, and it appears that keyservers are just too flakey to use in docker files
add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian stretch-cran35/'  # this will have to change when anaconda changes debian releases, but the tree sim packages require a more recent version of r than is in the debian repos
apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base
# UPDATE maybe should have this here somewhere https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/
```
Note that TreeSim/TreeSimGM may require a more recent R version than is in the default repos (check with `apt get show r-base-core`, then compare to requirements in TreeSim/TreeSimGM cran pages).
Note also that if you instead install R with conda, it replaces your entire compiler toolchain (e.g. screws up where your system looks for gcc) so you probably won't be able to compile anything afterwards.

You can then install the required R packages with the interactive R command:
```
> install.packages(c("TreeSim", "TreeSimGM", "geiger", "MASS"), repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies=TRUE)
```
If necessary, you will probably want to follow the prompts for installing to a personal (rather than system-wide) library location.
If you instead install from the command line with:
```
R --vanilla --slave -e 'install.packages(c("TreeSim", "TreeSimGM", "geiger", "MASS"), repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies=TRUE)'
```
You may need to run with `sudo -i` in front, and the resulting library permissions may cause problems.
The default mutation model also requires compilation of an updated (development) version of bpp that's in `packages/bpp-newlik/`:
```
./bin/build.sh with-simulation  # this takes a while, maybe 20-60 minutes
```
However, if you don't much care about mutation model accuracy (in particular, if you don't care about modeling different rates between different bases e.g. A->C vs A->T), you can set `--no-per-base-mutation` and it'll fall back to an older, already-compiled bpp version in `packages/bpp`.

#### MDS Plotting

In order to make the [MDS plots](plotting.md#partition-plots), you need R and the bios2mds package installed:

```
apt-get install xorg libx11-dev libglu1-mesa-dev r-cran-rgl  # may not be necessary, depending on existing R install, but is at least necessary in docker
conda install -y -cr r-rgl r-essentials
unset R_LIBS_SITE
R --vanilla --slave -e 'install.packages(c("class", "bios2mds"), dependencies=T, repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")'  # this may be all the deps: c("picante", "pspline", "deSolve", "igraph", "TESS", "fpc", "pvclust", "corpcor", "phytools", "mvMORPH", "geiger", "mvtnorm", "glassoFast", "Rmpfr")
```
