### partis

Partis is an HMM-based framework for B- and T-cell receptor sequence annotation, simulation, clonal family, and germline inference.
It is built on top of the [ham](https://github.com/psathyrella/ham) HMM compiler and [ig-sw](https://github.com/matsengrp/ig-sw) set of Smith-Waterman annotation tools.
